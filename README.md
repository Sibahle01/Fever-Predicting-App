## Fever-Predicting-App
This is a simple machine learning project that predicts whether a person has a fever based on input data such as body temperature and symptoms.

## Features:
Predicts fever using a trained machine learning model.
User-friendly interface for inputting data and viewing predictions.
Built using data from Kaggle for training and testing the model.
## Technologies Used:
Python: For data preprocessing and model training.
Machine Learning: Implementation using libraries like Scikit-learn.
Dataset: Sourced from Kaggle.

# How It Works:
Input health data (e.g., body temperature, symptoms).
The app processes the data using the trained model.
Outputs a prediction indicating whether the person has a fever.

# Purpose:
This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to machine learning concepts, focusing on real-world applications.
